# Testing Techniques Study Repository

Welcome to my testing techniques study repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey and learnings in the field of software testing. Here, you will find my studies made during the Method TAJS course from Erick Wendel. This readme is still in progress. It will be updated during my studies with more information.

## Introduction

In this project, I studied how tests using Jest works. During the lesson, Erick Wendel introduced us to the best practices of Jest. 

## Testing Methodologies

In this section, I will explore different testing methodologies, including unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, and performance testing. I will discuss the benefits of each methodology and provide examples and best practices.

## Debugging Strategies

The debugging strategies section will cover various techniques and tools that can be used to identify and fix issues in software. I will discuss logging, debugging tools, error handling, and other effective strategies for troubleshooting and resolving bugs.

## Best Practices

In the best practices section, I will share valuable tips and recommendations for effective testing and debugging. These best practices will help you improve the quality of your software and streamline your testing processes.

In the package.json file, we created 3 tests to run the tests in the terminal. During the studies, Git Bash were used as main terminal. Also, implemented the use of "cross-env" because it presented error in the terminal. To make things more interactive, we used NTL (Node Task List) to run the tests in the terminal (npm install -g ntl).

## Resources

I will compile a list of recommended resources, including books, articles, tutorials, and online courses, that can further enhance your understanding of testing techniques and debugging strategies.

## Technologies used
I used some technologies during my studies and here you can see all:
- VSCode
- Node.JS
- Jest
- Ubuntu 22.04LTS (Using WSL)
- Powershell
- Oh my zsh
- NPM
- NTL (Node Task List)
- GitHub Desktop
- GitHub Copilot
- Wakatime
